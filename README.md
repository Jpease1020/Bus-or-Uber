### Bus-or-Uber

### Pitch

The app will allow a user to input their current location and endpoint location and receive estimate of how long and how much it would cost to use either public transportation or an uber ride.  It will also aggregate the users usage of each over the course of time so they can see how much money and time they spend on each.  

### Problem

I am trying to solve the problem many college students and other young adults face when deciding between their budget and their time.  They can now make a decision to take the quicker but more expensive uber and the cheaper but longer transit ride with out guessing as to the amount and ride time of each.

### Solution

The user will input their current location and desired endpoint.  The app will make an api call out to uber's api and get an estimated time and cost of the trip.  It will make a separate call to the google directions api to get the estimated time of a mass transit ride.  The app will display to the user all the data allowing them to make an informed choice.  

### Target Audience

I see the app being most useable by the lower income population and college students.

### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?  I will be using the Uber api and google directions api.

* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?  Uber OAuth
