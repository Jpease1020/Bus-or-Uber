#?????????? try using more than one transit mode to get bus and train ???????????
# transit_mode â€” Specifies one or more preferred modes of transit. This parameter may only be specified for transit directions, and only if the request includes an API key or a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID. The parameter supports the following arguments:
# bus indicates that the calculated route should prefer travel by bus.
# subway indicates that the calculated route should prefer travel by subway.
# train indicates that the calculated route should prefer travel by train.
# tram indicates that the calculated route should prefer travel by tram and light rail.
# rail indicates that the calculated route should prefer travel by train, tram, light rail, and subway. This is equivalent to transit_mode=train|tram|subway.
